Welcome to my Blog! My name is Mary Farag, I'm a junior at East Brunswick High School. I love coding robots, playing lacrosse, and learning new things! I am currently documenting my life during these crazy times! 

As of yet, I have various accomplishments of which I am proud. I am a first degree black belt in taekwondo, a member of the girl's lacrosse team at my high school, a coder on the robotics team, an inductee of the National Honor Society, a volunteer at the East Brunswick Youth Council, as well as a member at various other organizations and clubs in my community. I hope to grow my accomplishments even further my senior year, through college, and throughout the rest of my journey.
