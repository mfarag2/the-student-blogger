Today's date is June 2nd, 2020. I have been in quarantine for 83 days. I have doing daily school work, spending more time with my family, 
eagerly waiting for summer to start or for the governor to make some sort of an announcement about the state of quarantine. 
The world has yet another crisis with the rise of protests worldwide in support of BLM. I haven't been allowed to attend one, 
as I have been stuck in my house since quarantine started. It feels as though I am watching history being made but cannot participate. 
But it still gives me hope to see the news about the protests online, knowing that my generation will bring about change to society.
