Today's date is May 22nd, 2020. I have been in quarantine for 72 days. Over the past few weeks I have been focusing on studying for my AP exams,
and today was the day of the last of these exams. They took up the majority of my days, leaving room to complete daily school work, eating, and maintaining hygiene. 
I had hoped that by now quarantine would have been lifted, so that I could enjoy my time with more freedom. Yet it looks like quarantine will go on for a bit longer.
Although now that exams are over, I will not be nearly as busy with work. I could spend more time outside, with my family, going on walks, or doing all sorts of activities.
Let's see what the future holds!
